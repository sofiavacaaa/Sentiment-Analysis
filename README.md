Project Objective

This project explores the evolution of sentiment analysis models through a comparison between traditional machine learning approaches and a modern large language model (LLM). Using the IMDB movie review dataset introduced by Maas et al. (2011), it evaluates the performance of classical techniques such as TF-IDF, Delta-IDF, LSA, LDA, and Word2Vec combined with classifiers like SVM and Logistic Regression. It then compares these with the performance of the LLaMA 3 model in a zero-shot setting via the Groq API.

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the [IMDB Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), introduced by Maas et al. (2011). It is a widely-used benchmark for binary sentiment classification.

This dataset contains:
- **25,000 labeled movie reviews** for training
- **25,000 labeled movie reviews** for testing
- A **balanced split** between positive and negative sentiment
- An additional **50,000 unlabeled reviews** for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning

The reviews are highly polarized, making it ideal for sentiment classification tasks. Each review is preprocessed and cleaned to remove HTML tags and unnecessary formatting.
